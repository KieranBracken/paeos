# PAEOS Derivation Chain

The complete, reproducible lineage from first principles to frozen kernel. These are
**archival derivation documents** — the reasoning, in the order it was produced. They are
frozen: they preserve what was derived and what the adversarial court reviewed, and are
**not** updated for later amendments. This is deliberate — an independent re-derivation,
constitutional audit, or blind reconstruction test must see the chain as it actually ran.

## The chain

| Doc | Title | Role in the lineage |
|---|---|---|
| PAEOS-0 | Foundations / Methodology | The five axioms + entropy law; how to derive an OS without cargo-culting |
| PAEOS-1 | Architecture | The reconciliation kernel: objects, lattice, roles, syscalls, invariants I1–I12 |
| PAEOS-2 | Founder Workflow | Existence-conditioned activities; the five founder verbs; router-not-pipeline |
| PAEOS-3 | Bootstrap | The cross-compilation resolution to the genesis paradox; SVK; self-hosting criterion |
| PAEOS-3.5 | Adversarial Ratification | Court verdict (RATIFY WITH AMENDMENTS) + the 19-amendment ledger |

## Where effective law lives (NOT here)

The derivation chain is the *source*. The current binding specification is downstream:

```
derivation/PAEOS-0..3.5   →  the reasoning (frozen, archival)
spec/PAEOS-4-kernel.md     →  the frozen kernel specification (all 19 amendments integrated)
spec/PAEOS-4.5-*.md        →  reference-implementation derivation
reviews/3.5-adversarial/   →  full adversarial working behind PAEOS-3.5
reviews/5.5-*/             →  implementation audit (kernel amendments B-*, pins SC-13..24)
reviews/6-hidden-*.md      →  Ω-01..27 hidden-assumption register (two passes)
backlog/                   →  PAEOS-5 constitutional implementation backlog
```

**When these disagree with a derivation document, the downstream document governs.** Each
derivation file's header lists the specific later amendments that supersede parts of it
(e.g., PAEOS-1's six primitives → four per A-02/A-03; PAEOS-2's decay theorem re-read per
Ω-14/19/22).

## Why the chain must be files (not just conversation)

Three constitutional reasons, in ascending force:

1. **Genesis requires it.** PAEOS-4 §13.1 mandates the genesis record carry
   `constitutional_basis: [HASH]` — content hashes of this corpus. Documents that exist
   only in a conversation cannot be hashed into the founding. **The chain must be files
   before S0 can legally begin.**
2. **The scar corpus imports from it.** PAEOS-3 §1 makes the PAEOS-0/1/2 derivations part
   of the pre-existing failure corpus that satisfies I7 for every genesis policy. G-CORPUS
   (Wave 0) mines these files.
3. **The reproducible-constitution test needs it.** PAEOS-3 §S5 defines a maturity audit
   that re-derives the constitution blind and flags divergence. That test is only
   meaningful against a fixed, archived original.

## Integrity

Derivation documents are append-only in spirit. A change to one is a change to the
lineage and must be recorded as an Incident against this chain (per PAEOS-4's closing
clause), never a silent edit. To correct a derivation, add a superseding downstream
document and cite it in the affected file's header — do not rewrite history (I4/K4).
